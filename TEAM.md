Seven years ago, Heatherm designed Talkbox Messenger, one of the first voice messenger apps, which had 13 million users. His second product MailTime Email Messenger debuted at the TechCrunch Disrupt, was awarded as “Best of 2015” by Apple with over 7 million users. Other than that, Heatherm’s team started an email intelligence company called Measurable AI, analyzing up to 15 billion anonymous consumer data.
