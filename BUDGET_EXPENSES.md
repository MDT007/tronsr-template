The cloud system we initially planned does not come with high configuration, thus we can save more space for future upgrades and ongoing-scaling.

1. We will pick the first primary node for launch and select another backup node in another city if it's necessary.
2. If storage isn't enough, we will take down primary storage and convert spare full nodes and storage into pure full nodes.
