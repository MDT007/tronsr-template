**Microsoft Azure Cloud Computing Virtual Machine**:

M64s: 64 vCPU(s), 1T RAM, 2T Temp Storage

Managed OS Disk:

P30: 1T SSD, 5K IOPS, 200 MB/Sec

**Cloud Locations**: 
Washington, USA and Singapore

We choose West USA and Southeast Asia with dual-system backup and our primary TRON block producer will be hosted on Google cloud and Azure.

Each location will have multiple nodes behind the network load balancer with multiple firewalls in order to provide better stability and data security performance.

**Planning For Scale**
**Security**:
1.         DDoS attack protection: stop attacks in minutes with our cloud solution.

2.         Our servers will install security updates automatically.

3.         The outgoing connections ensures our TRON SR primary block producer stay hidden from the internet while synching up to the blockchain and producing blocks.

 

**Monitoring**:
1.         Our servers will be monitored 24/7 and event handlers have been set up to restarting the process automatically.

2.         In order to further check our TRON processes running smoothly, we will continually verify our nodes and blocks are staying in sync with blockchain to provide better API services to others.

3.         We will also monitor the blocks produced by other 26 SR and compare the number against our nodes to ensure block producing consistency and balance within the TRON chain and keep updated for future expansion plans.

 

**Support**:
1.        Our monitoring solution will send alerts to our on call engineer once any outage notifications occurs within our infrastructure.

2.        We will setup a rotating team of multiple engineers to monitor our infrastructure.

3.        Our team will make quick turnaround to provide urgent service and support with solid experience and monitoring data to drive continuous improvement.nd Nodes in the Google and Azure cloud solutions.

 

**Custom Cloud Solution**:
1.        MDT is a decentralized data exchange economy adopted by Mailtime, award winning email solution app with 5 million users backed by world class investors. We are experts with solid knowledge in data field in years. After TRON mainnet launch, we will be working on moving our infrastructure to our own dedicated data center space.

2.        We will build up our custom cloud solution accordingly post launch.

3.        We will consider scale up to a multi data center solution to become truly independently decentralized but not relying on Google, Azure or Microsoft in the future.
